# work-day-scheduler

## Summary
In this assignment, we were given the task of creating a work day scheduler for teams to schedule tasks for every hour block. In order to accomplish this, we were provided `index.html` & `style.css`, so jQuery was used to populate this scheduler dynamically. 

Once an input is added to a row and saved, the task is saved to local storage. Once the page is refreshed the task remains. In addition to the functionality of scheduling tasks, each row is color coded depending on the current time of day. In order to accomplish this feature, I had to reference moment.js and write conditional formulas to dynamically style these rows.

Lastly, I provided a clear button in order to clear the scheduler and clear the stored data from the local storage.
